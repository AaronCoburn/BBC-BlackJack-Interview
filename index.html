    <title>Black Jack</title>
    <!-- Then I did a big heading to display the which game and describle the page. -->
    <h1>Black jack (21s)</h1>
    <!-- I created paragrapghs with hardcoded text to start structure for game. This contents will be changed using variables in JS for flexibilty. -->
    <!-- The format for the names is first the name of the Job being done and then add whatever it's going to be used for. For example info-el is the informational message used to give player informative text and el is short for Element because its element will be stored in a variable using JS.  -->
    <!-- The data-cy is for testing in Cypress. -->
    <!-- Info was created to give player message input to make game more interactive and playable. -->

    <!-- Cards was created to show the player each card number that's collected. -->
    <p data-cy="cardsCy" id="card-el">Cards:</p>
